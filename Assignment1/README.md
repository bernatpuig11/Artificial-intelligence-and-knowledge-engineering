## Assignment 1 : Genetic Algorithms


The main goal of this research is to find the best parameters of the Genetic Algorithm for the given PCB problem. We will try to find the optimum populationSize, crossoverRate, mutationRate, selectionMode (Roulette or tournament) and maxNumberGenerations (iterationsCount).
